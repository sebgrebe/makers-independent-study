## Benchmark tests for different Java methods

Folder structure:
- myAlgorithms: contains all algorithms I have written for this project week and tests for these.
- timing: contains the benchmark testing for those methods. I've written my own testing method for this.

### Array methods
Testing four different Array methods:
* get last item
* reverse
* shuffle
* sort

I've compared these with my own methods for reverse, shuffle, and sort.

All tests are done for different array sizes (range: 10 - 1000000).
Results can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M00Ww9iaW-4b57Mz7hGL7ILT1yaOMRixbhGv9CjBdVY/edit#gid=1038009516)

### Hash methods

Comparing hash and array methods for the following tasks:
- Duplicate: Given a list of words, find all words that appear more than once.
