# Chapter2-Datatypes

## Learning Objectives

- How to print to the console
- exposure to java data types
- repeatedly create, compile, and run small programs

## Instructions

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

in `/exercises/Strings.java`
- [ ] declare two string variables and store your names in them
- [ ] Print a message that contains your variables* something like `"John and Jane are learning Java!"`

\* *how would you do this in Ruby? How does Java do it?*

in `/exercises/Numbers.java`
- [ ] declare an integer variable with a value
- [ ] declare a `double` variable with a value
- [ ] store the result of adding the two together in a variable, and print it

in `/exercises/Arrays.java`
- [ ] create an array of strings and print it (what do you expect to see?)
- [ ] create an array of numbers and print it
- [ ] create an `ArrayList` of integers, add some integers to it and print it*

\* *you'll need to import a library of code to help here.*

*Sidenote: at some point we'd switch to working in an IDE like intelliJ that would automate imports, formatting and much more. However to keep things simple we'll continue to work with a simple editor*

## All done?! NICE! :tada:
Reflect on this exercise with your pair partner, maybe dive deeper into an area. Then keep on moving -> [chapter3][0]
