# Chapter3-JavaBuzz

## Learning Objectives

- How Java can do user input
- control flow
- loops
- create, compile, and run JavaBuzz

## Instructions

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

in `/exercises/ControlFlow.java`
- [ ] find a way to read in user input
- [ ] write a method that will check if a number is odd or even (assume user only ever enters integers)
- [ ] the result should be printed to the console eg:
- [ ] *bonus:* use a while loop to continue checking until the user types in my special number 17

```sh
5 # user enters a value
5 is odd # program prints result
```

in `/exercises/LoopThroughArray.java`
- [ ] loop through an integer array of the numbers 1-5 and print out each element

in `/exercises/JavaBuzz.java`
- [ ] write a program that will go through numbers 1-100 and print out "Java" if divisible by 3, "Buzz" if divisible by 5, "JavaBuzz" if divisible by 15
- [ ] create, compile, and run it, and then high five each other!

## All done?! NICE! :tada:
Reflect on this exercise with your pair partner, maybe dive deeper into an area. Then keep on moving -> [chapter4][0]
